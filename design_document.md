Bro‑Force‑Style Game Clone – Design Document
Executive overview
This document outlines the design for a run‑and‑gun platform game inspired by Broforce, the cult‑classic developed by Free Lives and published by Devolver Digital. The original game is a side‑scrolling run‑and‑gun title where players assume the role of one of several “bros”, hyper‑masculine parodies of action‑movie heroes, who fight terrorists and rescue prisoners through highly destructible environments
en.wikipedia.org
. Levels end when the player defeats a devil‑boss, raises a flag and escapes by helicopter amid massive explosions
en.wikipedia.org
. Each bro has unique attacks (e.g., flamethrowers or whips) and players are switched to a different bro upon death or when rescuing prisoners
en.wikipedia.org
. The game draws its ethos from 1980s–90s action movies, emphasising camaraderie, over‑the‑top violence and humour

Game concept and vision
Theme and narrative
Working title: “Freedom Bros: Edge of Anarchy”

A shadowy organisation has kidnapped world leaders and replaced them with robotic impostors. The “Freedom Bros”, a rag‑tag team of action‑heroes with diverse backgrounds, must infiltrate enemy territories, rescue hostages and topple the mad dictator behind the scheme. The tone is satirical, riffing on patriotic clichés and bombastic 80s‑movie tropes. Humour arises from over‑the‑top violence, cheesy one‑liners and unlikely scenarios like riding sharks in space

.

Core pillars
Chaotic run‑and‑gun action. Players navigate horizontally scrolling levels filled with enemies, traps and destructible terrain. Like the original game, nearly everything in the environment can be destroyed, encouraging creative approaches to combat
en.wikipedia.org
.

Diverse roster of “bros.” Characters parody famous film heroes but with original names and inclusive representation. Each bro has a unique weapon, special ability and mobility option, encouraging mastery of different play styles
en.wikipedia.org
.

Cooperative camaraderie. Local and online co‑op modes promote teamwork. As Evan Greenwood remarked, the appeal is that a bro will “do anything for his bros,” and the heroes work together to save each other and defeat enemies
polygon.com
. Players can revive downed teammates and use combined attacks.

Procedural missions with narrative arcs. While levels are hand‑crafted for set‑pieces, procedural variations keep playthroughs fresh. Each mission has optional objectives (e.g., stealth infiltration, time attacks) to increase replayability.

Inclusive heroism. Free Lives debated adding female characters and ultimately decided that female heroes should be part of the team, not separate or token
polygon.com
. Our clone embraces this ethos by including male, female and non‑binary bros as equals. The term “bro” is used as a gender‑neutral badge of camaraderie
en.wikipedia.org
.

Gameplay mechanics
Player characters and abilities
Players begin each mission as a randomly selected bro. Saving hostages or losing a life instantly switches them to another bro, mirroring the original game’s unpredictability
en.wikipedia.org
. Each bro features:

Primary weapon: unlimited ammo but different fire patterns (e.g., assault rifle, shotgun, whip, flamethrower). Some weapons are slow but powerful, while others fire rapidly with lower damage.

Special ability: limited‑use skill with a short recharge. Examples include area‑of‑effect grenade, temporary invincibility, grappling hook or slow‑motion “bro time.”

Movement quirk: double‑jump, air dash, wall‑climb or hover pack.

A sample roster:

Bro (working name)	Inspiration / archetype	Primary	Special ability	Movement quirk
Rambro	Jungle commando parody	Rapid‑fire assault rifle	Multi‑grenade barrage	Rope swing
Brox Speed	Cyber‑punk female biker	Laser SMG	Time‑dilation field slowing enemies	Air dash
Dr. Brogood	Mad scientist; non‑binary	Plasma beam	Deployable turret	Hover pack
She‑Bro	Amazonian warrior	Bow & explosive arrows	Berserk mode (increased damage)	Double‑jump
Cap’n Bro	Pirate hero	Musket & cutlass	Parrot drone that distracts enemies	Wall‑climb
Agent Broya	Spy parody	Silenced pistol	Cloaking device (temporary invisibility)	Roll dodge

Characters may be unlocked by rescuing specific numbers of hostages, encouraging exploration and replay.

Controls and actions
Movement: Left/right to run, down to crouch, up to climb ladders. Jump with A/space, double‑jump or dash depending on character.

Primary fire: Always available; infinite ammo but may require reload animation.

Special ability: Mapped to a separate key; has limited charges and cooldown.

Melee attack: Close‑range melee or context‑sensitive (e.g., whipping objects).

Interact: Rescue hostages, pick up power‑ups, plant bombs, or operate vehicles.

Revive: In co‑op, players can revive downed bros by standing over them briefly.

Level structure and objectives
Each mission is a side‑scrolling environment with multiple paths, secret areas and environmental hazards. Goals:

Rescue hostages. Each hostage rescued counts towards unlocking new bros and awards an extra life.

Destroy objectives. Missions may require planting explosives on structures, hacking computers or stealing enemy intel.

Boss encounter. End of mission features a miniboss (tank, helicopter, mutant) culminating in a devil‑boss fight
en.wikipedia.org
.

Extraction. After completing objectives, raise your flag and flee to a helicopter before the level self‑destructs
en.wikipedia.org
.

Mission environments are destructible; bullets and explosions erode terrain, enabling emergent strategies
en.wikipedia.org
. However, careless destruction can collapse structures and kill hostages.

Enemies and hazards
Mooks: Basic soldiers with rifles, occasionally throwing grenades. Suicide bombers sprint towards players and explode on contact.

Special forces: Heavier armour, riot shields or jetpacks. Require flanking or heavy firepower.

Creatures: Alien parasites, giant spiders, mutated dogs. Inspired by the “Alien‑inspired” updates of the original game.
broforce.fandom.com
.

Traps: Mines, collapsing floors, spike pits, toxic gas.

Bosses: Mechs, helicopters, giant monsters and demonic avatars. Bosses telegraph attacks, allowing players to dodge and counter.

Multiplayer and social features
Local co‑op: Up to four players on the same device or network using separate controllers. The screen zooms out to accommodate players.

Online co‑op: Peer‑to‑peer sessions using WebRTC or WebSockets. Leverage Firebase Realtime Database for session coordination and Cloud Functions for matchmaking.

Leaderboards: Track fastest mission completions, highest number of hostages rescued and highest chaos factor (points earned from destroying terrain). Use Firestore and Firebase’s built‑in analytics.

Achievements: In‑game challenges such as completing a mission without firing, rescuing 100 hostages, or finishing a mission without losing a bro.

Progression and unlocks
Rescuing hostages and completing objectives grants Bro Points. Points are used to unlock new characters, skins, weapons and power‑ups. Optional side missions and higher difficulty settings yield more points. Cosmetic unlocks (e.g., alternative costumes, palette swaps) allow for monetisation via micro‑transactions or DLC without affecting gameplay balance.

Art, audio and user experience
Visual style
Pixel art aesthetic: Faithful to Broforce’s 16‑bit look, with characters and environments rendered in chunky pixels. Colours are vibrant, with exaggerated blood splats and explosion effects. Use dynamic lighting and particle systems for modern polish.

Destructible tiles: Terrain is made of small tiles that can be destroyed individually, enabling dynamic landscapes.

Character design: Parody real‑world action heroes without using their exact likeness or names. Women and non‑binary characters share the same muscular, exaggerated style, honouring the original’s decision not to segregate characters
polygon.com
.

Cut‑scenes: Brief comic‑book panels before and after missions convey the tongue‑in‑cheek story.

Audio design
Music: High‑energy chiptune and heavy‑metal tracks reminiscent of 1980s action films. Use variations to intensify boss battles and quiet ambient cues during infiltration sections.

Sound effects: Over‑the‑top explosions, gunfire, ricochets and death screams. Each weapon has a distinctive sound. Use dynamic mixing to ensure clarity amidst chaos.

Voice lines: Campy one‑liners triggered when a bro enters a level or uses a special ability (“Get to the chopper!”, “Time to bro down!”). Include voices from both male and female actors to reflect the diverse cast.

Technical architecture
Client implementation
Engine: The front‑end will be built using Phaser 3 (an HTML5 game framework) with TypeScript. Phaser provides robust physics, animation and particle systems suitable for 2D platformers. Its WebGL and Canvas support ensures performance across browsers.

Module structure: Separate modules for rendering, physics, input, audio, UI, networking and data storage. Use an ECS (entity‑component system) pattern for extensibility.

Networking: Implement a deterministic simulation for co‑op using rollback networking (similar to GGPO) or simpler state‑sync for small player counts. Use WebRTC data channels for peer‑to‑peer communication and fallback to WebSockets via Firebase if direct peer connections fail.

Responsive design: The game will scale between desktop and mobile (touch controls overlay for mobile). However, destructive environment and multiplayer may be best experienced on desktop.

Backend services (Firebase)
Using Firebase Studio allows us to create and manage the backend directly from a cloud IDE. Key services:

Authentication: Support sign‑in via email, Google or anonymous accounts. Firebase Authentication provides secure user management, while Firebase Studio simplifies setup.

Database: Use Cloud Firestore to store player profiles, high scores, unlocks and saved games. Firestore’s document model offers flexibility and offline caching.

Functions: Implement server‑side logic with Cloud Functions for tasks such as verifying scores, awarding achievements, sending notifications and performing matchmaking. Functions run in a Node.js environment and can be deployed directly from Firebase Studio.

Messaging: Optional push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging to inform players of events (e.g., new update, friend invites).

AI assistance: Use Gemini in Firebase within Firebase Studio for code suggestions, documentation generation and bug fixes
firebase.google.com
.

Hosting & deployment (Cloudflare Workers)
Static content delivery: The compiled Phaser game (HTML, JavaScript bundles, images, audio) is served from Cloudflare Workers Sites or Pages. Cloudflare caches assets at edge locations worldwide for low latency, with automatic invalidation on deployment.

Serverless API endpoints: Lightweight API endpoints (e.g., scoreboard retrieval, match‑making) can be written as Workers functions. For example, a Worker can act as a proxy between the client and Firebase to enforce additional security or implement caching.

Dynamic computation: Use Workers KV or Durable Objects to cache frequently accessed data (e.g., global leaderboards) and reduce Firestore reads.

Global deployment: Cloudflare Workers’ serverless platform deploys code across its global network, providing high performance and reliability without complex configuration
developers.cloudflare.com
. Pricing is flexible and scales with usage
developers.cloudflare.com
.

Domain and TLS: Register a custom domain via Cloudflare and configure Workers to serve both the game and API over HTTPS.

Development workflow (Firebase Studio + Git)
Project setup: In Firebase Studio, create a new web project using the Next.js or plain JS template
firebase.google.com
. Configure the environment with Nix if necessary to include Phaser and Node dependencies
firebase.google.com
.

Import assets: Use the built‑in file manager to upload sprite sheets, audio and tilemaps. If starting from a Figma design, import UI components directly using Firebase Studio’s Figma import tool
firebase.google.com
.

AI‑assisted coding: Use Gemini in Firebase to scaffold code, refactor, write documentation and generate unit tests
firebase.google.com
.

Local testing: Run the local emulator suite to test Authentication, Firestore and Functions without deploying
firebase.google.com
.

Version control: Connect the Firebase Studio project to a GitHub repository. Use CI/CD (GitHub Actions) to run tests and deploy to Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler CLI.

Staging & production: Deploy preview builds to Cloudflare Workers for QA; once approved, promote to production via Git tags. Firebase Studio’s built‑in preview and monitoring tools help identify performance issues
firebase.google.com
.

Future expansions and roadmap
Mission editor: Provide players with a level editor built with React or Svelte, allowing them to create and share custom missions. Storage and sharing will be handled via Firestore; preview and publishing integrated with Firebase Studio.

Seasonal events: Release free updates with new bros, enemies and missions, following the example of the Broforce Forever expansion that added five new characters, new levels, updated textures and power‑ups
broforce.fandom.com
.

Competitive modes: Introduce deathmatch arenas and time trials with leaderboards. Optionally implement asynchronous multiplayer where players race to complete missions with ghost replays.

Cross‑platform ports: Once the web version is stable, consider exporting to consoles (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch) via frameworks like Unity or Godot. Online services will still be provided by Firebase, and Cloudflare can act as CDN for console patches.

Merchandising and community. Launch an official website and community hub using Firebase Hosting. Encourage modding through open APIs and host tournaments.

Conclusion
This design document outlines a modern run‑and‑gun platformer inspired by Broforce. By leveraging Firebase Studio for development, AI assistance and backend services, and Cloudflare Workers for global deployment, the project can be developed efficiently and delivered with high performance and reliability. The game honours the original’s chaotic spirit of camaraderie and explosive action while embracing inclusive characters and modern technology. With procedural missions, multiplayer co‑op, robust tooling and a clear roadmap for expansions, Freedom Bros: Edge of Anarchy has the potential to captivate fans of retro action games and new players alike.
