# AI Broforce: Recharged

## About the Project

**AI Broforce: Recharged** is a run-and-gun platform game heavily inspired by the cult-classic *Broforce*. It captures the anarchic spirit of the original, emphasizing chaotic action, over-the-top violence, and humor, while introducing modern features such as AI-generated inclusive characters, and a dynamic mission structure.

### Game Concept and Vision

**Working Title:** Freedom Bros: Edge of Anarchy

A shadowy organization has kidnapped world leaders and replaced them with robotic impostors. The "Freedom Bros", a rag-tag team of action-heroes with diverse backgrounds, must infiltrate enemy territories, rescue hostages, and topple the mad dictator behind the scheme. The tone is satirical, riffing on patriotic clich√©s and bombastic 80s-movie tropes. Humor arises from over-the-top violence, cheesy one-liners, and unlikely scenarios.

### Core Pillars

*   **Chaotic Run-and-Gun Action:** Players navigate horizontally scrolling levels filled with enemies, traps, and highly destructible terrain. Nearly everything in the environment can be destroyed, encouraging creative approaches to combat.
*   **Diverse Roster of "Bros":** Characters parody famous film heroes but with original names and inclusive representation (male, female, non-binary). Each bro has a unique weapon, special ability, and mobility option (e.g., double-jump, air dash, wall-climb, grappling hook), encouraging mastery of different play styles.
*   **Cooperative Camaraderie:** (Future expansion) Local and online co-op modes promote teamwork, allowing players to revive downed teammates and use combined attacks.
*   **Procedural Missions with Narrative Arcs:** While levels are hand-crafted for set-pieces, procedural variations keep playthroughs fresh. Each mission has optional objectives (e.g., stealth infiltration, time attacks) to increase replayability.
